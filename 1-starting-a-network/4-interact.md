# Interact with Your Node

Now that you've joined the network, you can interact with your own node.

## With the Apps UI

In the Apps UI, go to the `Settings` tab, and change the endpoint to `ws://localhost:9944`.

> **NOTE:** You cannot use Firefox to connect to a non-secure WebSocket endpoint
> (`ws://`) from a secure webpage (`https://`). So you may need to use Chrome or
> a Chromium-based browser.
